The molecular CO outflow shell is assumed to be the radially expanding parabolic shell generated by the underlying wide-angle wind. Following the simple analytical model by Lee et al. 2000 (2000, ApJ, 542, 925L), we have written this code. The results from this codes are presented in Dutta et al. 2023 (Under review). 


To use this code: 
download the whole file - 
simply change the data-directory and file names - 
use sensitivity to plot the contours - 
change contour levels, as you wish. decide the outflow-shell
change p and t0 values
see: is it fitting to your expected outflow shells?
