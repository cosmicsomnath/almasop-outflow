The molecular CO outflow shell is assumed to be the radially expanding parabolic shell generated by the underlying wide-angle wind. Following the simple analytical model by Lee et al. 2001 (\citet[][]{2000ApJ...542..925L}).   The outflow shells could be expressed in a cylindrical coordinate system:  z = cR^2, where R is the radial distance of the shell from the outflow axis z, and c is the curvature of the parabola near the origin of the outflow or launching zone. For a narrow position-velocity (PV) cut along the jet-axis, then $y^\prime$ (velocity) and $z^\prime$ (position) are the variables and, the emission along $x^\prime$ (or x) is essentially zero. The schematic diagram in Figure \ref{fig:appendix_Schematic_outflow_jet}b shows a PV diagram with an outflow shell and jet (knots).  The equation \ref{equ:inclination_final_previous_Equation} becomes 
\begin{equation}\label{equ:inclination_finalEquation}
    z^\prime \cos{i} - v_{obs}t_0 \sin{i} = c[(-v_{obs} t_0 \cos{i} - z^\prime \sin{i})^2]
\end{equation}
The curvature $c$ is known from the fitting to the integrated emission (zeroth moment) maps (equation \ref{equ:inclination_ZCR2}). We can vary $i$ and $t_0$ to obtain the parabolic fit of the PV diagram.
