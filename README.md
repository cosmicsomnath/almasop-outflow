The molecular CO outflow shell is assumed to be the radially expanding parabolic shell generated by the underlying wide-angle wind. Following the simple analytical model by Lee et al. 2000 (2000, ApJ, 542, 925L), we have written this code. The results from this codes are presented in Dutta et al. 2023 (Under review). 


To use this code: 

step1: download the whole code including data - 

step2: simply change the data-directory and file names - 

step3: use sensitivity to plot the contours - 

step4: change contour levels, as you wish. decide the outflow-shell

step5: change p and t0 values

step6: see: is it fitting to your expected outflow shells?
